# Bear Clicker: Before

A "before" version of a bear clicker app designed from scratch for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree. The next step is learning how to make it better using better programming techniques.

## How to View it

The site is hosted through [GitHub](https://angelaroth.github.io/bear-clicker/)

## How to Use it

Choose a Bear by clicking on their name. Then, give the bear salmon by either clicking the bear's picture or by clicking their name again when they are already visible.

Selecting a new bear will not make previously clicked bears lose their salmon, but refreshing the screen will revert all salmon counts to zero.

Something happens whenever a bear's salmon count is a multiple of five.
